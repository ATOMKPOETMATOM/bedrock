  <p>
    {% trans license=url('foundation.trademarks.policy') %}
      What you can and cannot do with our Firefox software products and code – independent of our trademarks – is governed by a separate document, the <a href="{{ license }}">Mozilla Public License</a>. In turn, the Mozilla Public License does not contain any rules on our trademarks, as is expressly mentioned in its section 2.1. "Grants":
    {% endtrans %}

    <i>"Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license: (a) under intellectual property rights (<u>other than patent or trademark</u>)…"</i>

      If you wish to distribute Firefox branded with our trademarks, you must comply with the Mozilla Public License, the Mozilla Trademark Guidelines and either the below Unaltered Firefox Distribution Policy or the terms of a written distribution agreement with Mozilla.

  <h2>{{ _('Unaltered Firefox Distribution Policy') }}</h2>

  <p>
    {% trans mozorg=url('mozorg.home') %}
    You may distribute unaltered copies of Mozilla Firefox from <a href="{{ mozorg }}">Mozilla.org</a> without express permission from Mozilla as long as you comply with the following rules:
    <ul>
      <li>
        You may not charge for Firefox. That means:
        <ul>
          <li>Distribution may not be subject to any fee.</li>
          <li>Distribution may not be tied to purchasing a product or service.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>You may not collect personal information in the context of your distribution of Firefox.</li>

      <li>You may not add to, remove, or change any part of Firefox, including the Mozilla trademarks themselves. For example, you may not add any extensions to Firefox.</li>

      <li>You may not modify the installation process of Firefox or use it to install any other themes, plugins, extensions, or software.</li>

      <li>We suggest that if you want to distribute Firefox, you do so by linking to official downloads of Firefox at <a href="{{ mozorg }}">Mozilla.org</a> to help ensure safe, reliable downloads. If you wish to directly distribute copies of Firefox yourself, you must distribute the latest stable version available at <a href="{{ mozorg }}">Mozilla.org</a>.</li>

      <li> When distributing you must distribute the most recent version of Firefox.</li>

      <li>For Android versions of Firefox that you are distributing on a device: (1) the device must have at least 512MB of RAM; and (2) if the device does not have Google Play installed, you must have a means for providing the user with Firefox updates as they are released by Mozilla (see the release calendar https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar).</li>
    </ul>
    {% endtrans %}
  </p>

      Mozilla reserves the right to change this Unaltered Firefox Distribution Policy by posting changes on this webpage.
    {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h2>{{ _('Modified Versions Require Prior Written Permission') }}</h2>
  <p>
    {% trans %}
      The open source nature of Firefox allows you to freely download and modify the Firefox source code. However, if you make <i>any</i> changes to Firefox, you may not redistribute that product using <i>any</i> Mozilla trademark without Mozilla’s prior written consent and, typically, a distribution agreement with Mozilla.  For example, you may not distribute a modified form of Firefox and continue to call it Firefox.
      <ul>
        <li>Changes requiring Mozilla’s prior written permission include (but are not limited to):
          <ul>
            <li>Changing the default home page or adding bookmarks,</li>
            <li>Adding, modifying, or deleting source files,</li>
            <li>Adding, modifying, or deleting content from installer files,</li>
            <li>File location changes,</li>
            <li>Adding extensions, add-ons or plugins, or</li>
            <li>Installing themes other than those available in the most recent stable version of Firefox available at Mozilla.org.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
